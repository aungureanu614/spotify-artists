##Background

This is an extension of Artist Finder. It includes the feature of being able to rate the searched artist's playlist and see an average rating based on other user's rating of the playlist. 

##Use Case

Why is this app useful? Spotify doesn't currently offer the option of rating a playlist and seeing average ratings from other users. It's nice to have a way of seeing what others thought of the compilation of tracks

##Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: https://lit-wave-43289.herokuapp.com/#/

##Functionality
The app's functionality includes:

* Searching for an artist
* Playing a top 10 track list for the searched artist
* Playing a top 10 track list for 5 artists that are related to the searched artist
* Rating the searched artist's playlist

##Technical

The app is built using:

* Node.js
* React
* JSX
* CSS
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Spotify API

##Development Roadmap

Future features to be added to the app are:

* A user login page
* Ratings for each related artist's playlist
* Star ratings rather than 1-5 for better visual effect
* Being able to save playlists
