##Background

I built this app to discover new artists that are related to an artist that I like and find new songs from those related artists.

##Use Case

Why is this app useful? It's hard to find good music and it's easy to become bored of listening to the same songs over and over. Using Spotify's API, I created a way to find artists related to a searched artist and their current top 10 songs.

##Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: https://aungureanu614.github.io/

##Functionality
The app's functionality includes:

* Searching for an artist
* Playing a top 10 track list for the searched artist
* Playing a top 10 track list for 5 artists that are related to the searched artist

##Technical

The app is built using:

* JavaScript
* React
* JSX
* CSS
* HTML
* Spotify API

##Development Roadmap

Future features to be added to the app are:

* Being able to rate the playlist of the searched artist
* Creating a user login so that each user can personalize their lists
* Saving playlists
